# Movie Project

This project is a C++ application designed to manage a movie database. The application allows users to add new movies, search for movies by various criteria (title, genre, year, rating), and display detailed information about each movie. It aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for managing a collection of movies and allows users to quickly find movies based on their preferences.

The program uses a class-based approach to organize movie data, where each movie has attributes such as title, year, genre, and rating. The movies are stored in a dynamic list, allowing users to filter and search for movies based on different attributes.
